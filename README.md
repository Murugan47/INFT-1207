The goal of Lab's 1 code is to make a secure password generator. Based on user-defined criteria, with a focus on 
writing a maintainable clear and well structured python code with unit tests to ensure reliability.

This lab is done with a pair of students, the requirements of the code are:
- Length of the users desired password (between 8 and 20 characters)
- Number of letters in the password (uppercase and lowercase)
- Number of digits in the password
- Number of special characters in the password
- All of this is done while validating each input from the user
- All errors must be handled
- And the returned passwords order of letters, digits and special characters should be random
- All the while following PEP8 Python Style Guide
